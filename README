ClearPress MVC Framework
========================

ClearPress is a basic, light, but easily extensible MVC framework
written in Perl.  It was built on a need to be dependency-light and
integrate closely with code used to drive existing websites the author
had been involved with in the past.

ClearPress is still very new and under active development though quite
stable in production at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Oxford
Nanopore Technologies and my various of my "non-work" work projects (
http://psyphi.net/ ).
