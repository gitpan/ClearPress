ClearPress MVC Framework
========================

ClearPress is a basic, light, but easily extensible MVC framework
written in Perl.  It was built on a need to be dependency-light and
integrate closely with code used to drive existing websites the author
had been involved with in the past.

ClearPress is still very new and under active development though quite
stable in production. This release represents the first product
increment following a three-week code sprint starting in the middle of
May 2007.

I plan to release more complete documentation with the current or next
code sprint.
